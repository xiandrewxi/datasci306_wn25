## Stats 306: Introduction to Statistical Computing

This course introduces basic concepts in computer programming and statistical computing techniques as they are applied to data extraction and manipulation, statistical processing and visualization. It is aimed primarily at undergraduate majors and minors in Statistics.

*Enforced Pre-requisite: [DATASCI 101 or STATS 206 or STATS 250 OR STATS 280 OR STATS 412 or ECON 451 or IOE 265] AND prior or concurrent enrollment in [MATH 116 or MATH 121 or MATH 156 or MATH 176 or MATH 186 or any 200+ level math credit except for MATH 201].*

## Data Science Workflow

When performing data analysis, we often follow a common set of steps.

During the course, we will learn to use *problem decomposition* to break each of these steps into even smaller tasks.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will

* have a rigorous understanding of the structure of computer programs including
  * variables
  * functions
  * iteration
  * input/output
* have thorough familiarity with the R programming language and RStudio development environment
* be able to load, manipulate, and present data
* manage development projects using the Git version control package
* use an AI assistant to help produce working, tested code

## Overview of Course

* Lecture: introduce concepts and key R programming tools, frequent exercises
* Lab: Hands on programming experience with GSI assistance
* Homework: Independent learning in structured format
* Projects: Open ended opportunities to demonstrate abilities
* Quizzes: Quick checks of comprehension, maintain pace

## Example Exercise

Bring a laptop (or even a tablet!) to class:

We will frequently stop an engage in exercises. For example,

Add the values two and three:

```{r add23, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r add23-hint}
2  + ...
```

```{r add23-solution}
2 + 3
```


## Grading

The course will be based on the following structure:

* Homework Assignments (50%) (11 assignments, lowest dropped)
* Quizzes (15%) (13 quizzes, three lowest  dropped)
* Project 1 (10%)
* Project 2 (25%) 

Late homework will not be accepted. Please email your GSI if you have circumstances requiring an extension.

## Working in Groups

You are encouraged to work together on **all class material** except quizzes to discuss
solutions and debug. Each student must submit own work. Ask yourself, "Am I
avoiding learning something in my actions?" If yes, don't do it.

## Materials

All books are freely available through our library system or online:

* Our main text book is [R for Data Science (2ed)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garett Grolemund
* Later in the semester, we will pull additional material from
    * [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html)
    * [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/)
* For learning git, we will use [Beginning Git and GitHub](https://search.lib.umich.edu/catalog/record/99187305231206381) by
Mariot Tsitoara.
* For statistical background, we suggest [Practical Statistics for Data Scientists](https://search.lib.umich.edu/catalog/record/99187344801606381)


## Student Hours and Help

* Instructor Zoom student hours TBA 
* GSI office hours: You may attend any GSI's hours
* Questions:
  * HW/projects/content: Piazza on Canvas
  * Personal issues (extensions, grades, etc): Helpdesk ticket on Canvas

## Software

* R: A statistical programming language
* Posit Cloud: A development environment for R
* Git: Version control and collaboration for software projects
* GitHub Copilot: AI programming assistant

  
## R

R is a *statistical programming language*:

* Statistical: designed for the manipulation and analysis of data
* Programming: perform analysis through collection of instructions
* Language: text based, as opposed to graphical, instructions

## Why use R?

* Purpose built for statistical analysis
* Large collection of add-on libraries containing cutting edge resources
* Being adopted by research, industry, government
* Language of choice for statistical teaching (courses, books)

## Posit Cloud

Posit Cloud is an online *integrated development environment* (IDE) for R (and other languages).

Visit [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud) for a walkthrough.

## Using our Posit Cloud

* There is a main module: **UPDATE WITH SEMESTER**. If you load this it will be a *temporary* copy. If you wish to retain any notes, you must **make it permanent**.
* If you make it permanent, you will need to update using `git` (more on this shortly)
* Homework assignments will be distributed as weekly modules. When opened they will automatically be made permanent.

## Git

* Git is a **version control system** manages changes from multiple sources simultaneously.
* A reasonable analogy: Google Docs with track changes turned on
* Useful for groups working together to track changes to the software package and document why changes were made

## GitHub and Copilot

* GitHub is a website/company providing hosting for projects using the git version control system. 
* You don't have to use GitHub if you use git, but it has become very popular (provides free hosting for small projects).
* Acquired by Microsoft in 2018
* Released a Large Language Model (LLM) artificial intelligence (AI) assistant Copilot in 2021.
* We will cover how to connect Posit Cloud to GitHub and use Copilot in a later lecture.

## GitHub for Education

* Copilot is typically a paid service, but you can sign up for [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application) for free.
* Make sure you use your `umich.edu` email address. You can [link your UM email address in your account settings](https://github.com/settings/emails) if you already have a GitHub account under another email.

## RStudio

You may encounter the name **RStudio** in various online documentation. 

This is the name a desktop version of the editor we are using (formerly it was called RStudio Cloud).

If you wish, you can [install R and RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) on your own computer. 

You can get the materials using `git` as described on Canvas, but this will not be directly supported during the course. You will need to download the assignments on Posit cloud.

## Final notes

<!-- Notes about logistics go here, .e.g.,
**No lab this week**. Next activity is lecture on Tuesday.

Join the Stats 306 workspace on Posit (see Canvas). Try out the example module.
