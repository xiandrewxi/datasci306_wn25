## Statistical programming

Recall that R is a **statistical** programming language. In statistics we often work with:

>* **Samples**, composed of individual units
>* **Variables**, something measured on each unit in the sample

Tabular data: columns are variables, rows are observations

## Lists and Vectors

* A **vector** is an ordered collection of the same type of data. Created using the `c` function (concatenate).
* A **list** is an ordered collection of (potentially) different types of data. Created using the `list` function.
* Both can have **names** to indicate individual items.
* Lists can serve a similar role to dictionaries and hash tables in other languages.

## Vectors, basic

```{r}
phone_digits <- c(8, 6, 7, 4, 3, 0, 9)
phone_plus_area_code <- c(7, 3, 4, phone_digits)
length(phone_plus_area_code)
sum(phone_plus_area_code)
```

## Vectors, indexing

The `runif` function will create randomly generated values in the range (0, 1).

```{r}
random_u01 <- runif(10) # create 10 values
print(random_u01)
random_u01[1] # first item
random_u01[10] # last item
random_u01[-1] # all but first
random_u01[1:3] # first three
random_u01[3:6] # a "slice" in the middle
random_u01[c(1, 3, 7, 1)] # arbitrary choices
```


## Exercise

Pull out the last three items in the vectors `letters`. A little help to get you started:

```{r lettersxyz, exercise = TRUE}
length(letters)
```


```{r lettersxyz-solution}
letters[c(24, 25, 26)]
letters[-(1:23)]
```

## Relational Operators

```{r}
x <- 1
y <- 2

x < y
x > y
x <= y
x >= y
x == y
x != y

!(x == y) # negation
```

## Vectors, subsetting based on qualities

```{r}
less_than_0.5 <- random_u01 < 0.5
print(less_than_0.5)
random_u01[less_than_0.5]
keep(random_u01, random_u01 < 0.5)
```

## Exercise

Use the following hint to keep only the even numbers.

```{r}
(7 %% 2) == 0 
(8 %% 2) == 0
```


```{r onlyodd, exercise = TRUE}
x <- 1:10
```

```{r onlyodd-solution}
x <- 1:10
keep(x, (x %% 2) == 0)
```


## Lists, heterogenous collections

Vectors must be the same type, lists can be **heterogeneous**:
```{r}
list("string", 7, 1:4)
```

## Named collections

Vectors can have names (`c(first = 1, second = 22, third = 333)`), but names for lists are more common.
```{r}
named_list <- list(a_string = "A string", a_vector = 1:4)
named_list[["a_string"]] # note double brackets
named_list$a_vector
```

## Tables: Lists of Vectors

* In a **sample**, we suppose we have $k$ variables measured for each of $n$ units.
* For each variable, place the $n$ values in a vector.
* Collect all such vectors into a list of length $k$.
* Result: $n \times k$ table

## Tables in R

There are a few different types of tables in R (`data.frame`, `tibble`). We will treat them interchangeably for the most part.

```{r}
class(mpg)
dim(mpg)
colnames(mpg)
head(mpg)
```

## Accessing individual columns

Recall, the `$` operator lets us get items from lists:

```{r}
mpg$hwy |> mean() # equiv to mean(mpg$hwy)
```

## Functions for basic descriptive statistics

```{r}
sum(mpg$hwy)
mean(mpg$hwy)
var(mpg$hwy)
sd(mpg$hwy) 
median(mpg$hwy)
IQR(mpg$hwy)
quantile(mpg$hwy, c(0.25, 0.75))
```

## Exercise

What is the average `year` of the cars in `mpg`? What is the standard deviation of the city mileage (`cty`)?

```{r mpgsummary, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r}
mean(mpg$year)
mpg$cty |> sd()
```



## Dealing with missingness

Here's a vector with some missing values
```{r}
v <- c(1, NA, 2, 10, 3, NA)
mean(v)
```

To delete the missing values we have some options:
```{r}
mean(v, na.rm = TRUE)
na.omit(v) |> mean()
v[!is.na(v)] |> mean()
```

## Plotting: Visual representation of data

**Graphing** or **plotting** is the representation of data in a visual form, typically on a 2D plane.

Humans have a wonderful ability to process visual stimuli quickly.

Great for displaying large data sets that might be difficult to describe.

## Plotting ain't easy

* What exactly can we put in a plot?
* How to connect the plot to data?
* What are our goals for the plot?
* What additional information is necessary to understand the plot?

## The Semiology of Graphics

In 1967, **Jacques Bertin** published the *Semiology of Graphics* to describe common elements of plots and what they could achieve.

Bertin described two ways of thinking about plots:

1. Visual ("retinal") variables: connections between objects in the plot and underlying data
2. Relationship what types of relationships can the visual variables express

## Visual variables/retinal variables:

* Position/planar dimensions
* Size (small to large)
* Value (light to dark)
* Texture (pattern)
* Color (discrete or continuously varying)
* Orientation (angle/rotation)
* Shape (usually distinct shapes)

## Relationships

* Selection: find groups that are the same
* Association: find units in different groups that share qualities
* Order: natural sequence in the variable
* Quantitative: read relative differences as actual changes in data

## The Grammar of Graphics and `ggplot`

A follow up to Bertin's work was *The Grammar of Graphics* by Leland Wilkinson.
This book described a programming language for graphics based on ideas in
Bertin's system.

The GoG was implemented for R in `ggplot` (and later replaced by `ggplot2`). (See
the GGPlot Book on Canvas for more details.)

## The components of a ggplot graph

* The graph object itself (creating using `ggplot(data)`)
* A set of *aesthetic* mappings (connecting data to visual variables)
* Layers: collections of geometric elements (`geom_*()`) and statistical transformations (`stat_*()`)
* Scales: information on the range or composition of variables
* Coordinate systems: how the data are arranged spatially
* Facet: breaking a single plot into many, similar plots
* Theme: all the other color and printing aspects of the plot

## Creating a ggplot

Start use the `ggplot` function to start our plot
```{r}
efficiency <- ggplot(data = mpg)
class(efficiency)
efficiency # for now, blank
```

## Connecting columns to visual variables

What can we plot?
```{r}
colnames(mpg)
```

"Aesthetic" mappings connect columns to visual variables
```{r}
efficiency <- ggplot(data = mpg,
                     aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl))
```

## Geometries: objects on the plot

In the previous we connected visual variables to columns, now we need to explain how to display them.

We will use a **geometry function** (have the form `geom_TYPE()`).

```{r}
efficiency + geom_point()
```

## Alternative form

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl))
```

## Exercise: Great Lakes water levels

Here's a data set from the US Army Corps of Engineers showing the height of the Great Lakes (with Michigan and Huron being one body) above sea level, aggregate by year.

```{r}
glwl <- read_csv("data/GLHYD_data_english_cleaned.csv.gz") |>
  group_by(body, year) |> summarize(ht = median(height_ft)) |> ungroup()
glwl
```

Use this data set to make a scatter plot of the height of each lake in each year, colored by which `body` the reading is from.

```{r glwl-plot-setup}

glwl <- read_csv("data/GLHYD_data_english_cleaned.csv.gz") |>
  group_by(body, year) |> summarize(ht = median(height_ft)) |> ungroup()
```

```{r glwl-plot, exercise = TRUE}
```

```{r glwl-solution}
ggplot(glwl, aes(x = year, y = ht, color = body)) + geom_point()
ggplot(glwl, aes(x = year, y = ht, color = body)) + geom_line()
```


Improve your plot by changing it to a `geom_line()`

## What aesthetic mappings can I use?

Let's visit the docs: [`geom_point`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_point.html)

## Trying out some other mappings

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg,
       aes(x = displ, y = hwy,
           size = cyl,
           color = class)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## Using expressions

We can also use expressions involving columns.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg,
       aes(x = displ, y = hwy,
           shape = year > 2000)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## Overriding parameters for all points

We can pass in constants that apply to all points (size and transparency):

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg,
       aes(x = displ, y = hwy,
           shape = year > 2000)) + 
  geom_point(size = 5, alpha = 0.5)
```

## Jitter: useful noise

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg,
       aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(position = "jitter")
```

## Other geometries

Points are great for graphing two **quantitative** or **continuous** variables.
For **discrete** or **qualitative** we need other tools.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg,
       aes(x = displ, y = class)) + 
  geom_boxplot() 
```

## List of geometries

[More ggplot documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#geoms).


## General observations

* Generally limit plots to having 3 or 4 distinct visual variables
* Typically only one geometry type, but there are some great counter examples
* Almost everything can be tweaked in ggplot, finding it is the tricky part
* The [R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/) is a great source of inspiration and instruction
