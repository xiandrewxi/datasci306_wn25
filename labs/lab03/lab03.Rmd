## Set up

```{r installPackages, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# This just checks if students need to install some packages that they might 
# not have.
```

```{r setup, echo=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)  # For ggplot2, dplyr
library(learnr)
```


## Table operations

Today we are going to focus on functions in the `dplyr` package, which is part of the `tidyverse`. 
The `dplyr` package aims to provide a function for each basic "verb" of data manipulation. 
Here are some common functions / "verbs" for data manipulation: 

* Rows: 
    + `filter()`: Select rows based on criteria on column values
    + `slice()`: choose rows based on locations.
    + `arrange()`: change the order of the rows.
* Columns: 
    + `select()`: Pick and choose columns to include in data.
    + `pull()`: Select a single column (similar to `data$column`).
    + `rename()`: Change the name of columns.
    + `mutate()`: Change the values of columns / creates new columns. 
* Groups (of rows):
    + `group_by()`: Creates a group of rows.
    + `summarise()` or `summarize()`: Calculate summary values for a given group. 

## `select()`, `filter()`, `mutate()` Examples

We are going to look at the `midwest` data again.

```{r}
head(midwest)
```

### `select`

It you might like to have the help file for the select function open. Run

```{r eval = FALSE}
?select
```

in the Console tab.

### Exercise 1 {-}

#### (a) {-}

Use `select` to pick the columns that are related to population counts:

```
"poptotal"        "popdensity"      "popwhite"        "popblack"        "popamerindian"  
"popasian"        "popother"        "popadults"       "poppovertyknown"
```

```{r midwestSelect1, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r midwestSelect1-solution}
select(midwest, poptotal, popdensity, popwhite, popblack, popamerindian,  
         popasian, popother, popadults, poppovertyknown) 
```

#### (b) {-}

Select everything **except** `PID` and `poptotal`:

```{r midwestSelect2, exercise=TRUE}
```
```{r midwestSelect2-solution}
midwest %>%
  select(-PID, -poptotal) 
```

##### (c) {-}

Use the `where` and `is.character` function to select only columns containing strings/character vectors.

```{r midwestSelect3, exercise=TRUE}
```

```{r midwestSelect3-solution}
midwest %>%
  select(where(is.character)) %>%
  head()
```


### `filter`
`filter()` allows us to select certain rows. 

Observe the following way to tell if a county is in Michigan:

```{r}
midwest$state == "MI"
```

#### Exercise 2 {-}

##### (a) {-}

Use code similar (but not the same as) the above to find all rows for counties in MI

```{r midwestFilter1, exercise=TRUE}
```


You can include more than one condition at a time by adding additional qualifications. 

```{r}
midwest %>%
  filter(state == "MI", county == 'WASHTENAW')
```

##### (b) {-}

Select all counties in Michigan with a `percollege` value greater than 17 (approximately the median in the entire data set).

```{r midwestFilter2, exercise=TRUE}
```

```{r midwestFilter2-solution}
  filter(state == "MI", percollege > 16)
```
Another way to do this filter is to use the "and" operator `&`

```{r}
midwest %>%
  filter(state == "MI" & percollege > 16)
```

There is also an "or" operator `|`.

##### (c) {-}

Use the `|` operator to find rows in either Wisconsin or Ohio.

```{r midwestOrOperator, exercise=TRUE}
```

When filtering rows for many values in the same column, the `%in%` operator can be useful. Here's an example of it's usage

```{r}
c("WI", "MI", "OH", "OH", "IA") %in% c("WI", "OH")
```

##### (d) {-}

Use the `%in%` operator to repeat the previous selection of counties in Wisconsin or Ohio.

```{r midwestinoperator, exercise=TRUE}
```

```{r midwestinoperator-solution}
midwest |>
  filter(state %in% c("WI", "OH"))
```

### Putting `filter` and `select` together

##### (e) {-}

Make a table using all the rows from Wisconsin and Ohio but only the columns `PID` and `area`

```{r midwestfilterselect, exercise = TRUE}
```

```{r midwestfilterselect-solution}
midwest |>
  filter(state %in% c("WI", "OH")) |>
  select(PID, area)
```

## Mutate
`mutate()` can be used to either create or modify a column in a dataset. 
We can pipe multiple functions together. 

Try running the following code:
```{r mutate1, exercise=TRUE}
midwest %>%
  filter(state == 'MI') %>%
  mutate(school = ifelse(county == "WASHTENAW", "GO BLUE!!!", "OTHER")) %>%
  mutate(county == tolower(county)) %>%
  select(state, county, school) %>%
  tail()
```

#### Exercise 3 {-}

##### (a) {-}

Create a new column finds the number of non-adults per county (i.e., the difference between `poptotal` and `popadults`):

```{r mutate2, exercise=TRUE}
```

```{r mutate2-solution}
midwest |>
  mutate(children = poptotal - popadults) |>
  select(children)
```
##### (b) {-}

Mutate can make more than one column. Using only one call to `mutate`, create a `childrendensity` by dividing the number of children by area.

```{r mutate3, exercise=TRUE}
```

```{r mutate3-solution}
midwest |>
  mutate(children = poptotal - popadults,
         childrendesnity = children / area) |>
  select(children, childrendesnity)
```

We can use `arrange()` to order the columns of the data. 

```{r arrange1, exercise=TRUE}
midwest %>%
  select(state, county) %>%
  arrange(desc(state), county) %>%
  head()
```

##### (c) {-}

Find the county with the highest population (`poptotal`) in the data set:

```{r arrange2, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r arrange2-solution}
midwest %>%
  arrange(desc(poptotal)) |>
  head(1)
```

Another useful tool is `slice()`. This function allows us to select certain rows. There are a few versions of this that each give different results. See `?slice` for more details.

The previous example could have been written as:

```{r slice1, exercise=TRUE}
midwest %>%
  slice_max(poptotal)
```

## `group_by()` and `summarize()` 

`group_by()` helps us create groups. 
The following code will get the maximum population county for each state in the dataset. 

```{r groupby1, exercise=TRUE}
midwest %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  slice_max(poptotal)
```

#### Exercise 4 {-}

##### (a) {-}

Use `group_by` and `slice_max` to find the largest metro and non-metro counties (`inmetro`):

```{r groupbymetro, exercise=TRUE}
```

```{r groupbymetro-solution}
midwest %>%
  group_by(inmetro) %>%
  slice_max(poptotal)
```

`summarize()` (or equivalently, `summarise()`) is a function that's not particularly useful on it's own, but when combined with `group_by()` it can be very useful.
The following code counts the number of counties in each state

```{r summarize1, exercise=TRUE}
midwest %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(n_counties = n()) %>%
  arrange(-n_counties)
```

##### (b) {-}

Use `group_by()` and `summarize()` to get the total population in each state (hint, we want to *sum* up the `poptotal` column). Then, arrange the states so that states with the smallest population comes first.

```{r groupExercise, exercise=TRUE}
```

```{r groupExercise-solution}
midwest |>
  group_by(state) |>
  summarize(state_pop = sum(poptotal)) |>
  arrange(desc(state_pop))
```
##### (c) {-}

**BONUS** Modify your previous solution to also calculate the percentage of the population that is White, Black, and Asian. 

```{r groupExercisebonus, exercise=TRUE}
```

```{r groupExercisebonus-solution}
midwest %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(state_population = sum(poptotal),
            precent_black = sum(popblack) / state_population,
            percet_white = sum(popwhite) / state_population,
            percent_asian = sum(popasian) / state_population) %>%
  arrange(state_population)
```

## `group_by()` and `mutate()` to normalize column values 
You can also use `group_by()` and `mutate()` sequentially to normalize columns for just that groupings. Let's say you want to see the relative county level percent with highschool diploma compared to their state average. You can then use `group_by()` and `mutate()` as follows. Notice that we include `mean_perch_sd` and the `select()` for ease of viewing the results.

```{r}
midwest |>
  group_by(state) |>
  mutate(normalized_perch_sd = perchsd - mean(perchsd),
         mean_perch_sd = mean(perchsd)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  select(county, state, perchsd, normalized_perch_sd, mean_perch_sd)
```


#### Exercise 5 {-}

Use `group_by()` and `mutate()` to normalize county values of percent of population is college educated (`percollege`) based on if the county is considered in a metro area (`inmetro`)

```{r groupNormalize, exercise=TRUE}
```

```{r groupNormalize-solution}
midwest |>
  group_by(inmetro) |>
  mutate(normalized_percollege = percollege - mean(percollege),
         mean_percollege = mean(percollege)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  select(county, state, percollege, normalized_percollege, mean_percollege)
```
